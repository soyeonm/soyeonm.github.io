I am a fourth year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University's Machine Learning Department (MLD), co-advised by Professors [**Ruslan Salakhutdinov**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) and [**Yonatan Bisk**](https://yonatanbisk.com/index.html). My research is funded by **Apple AI/ ML scholars fellowship 2023**.
I earned my B.S. and M.Eng at MIT, as the **second place recipient of the Charles & Jennifer Johnson Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making M.Eng Thesis Award**.
