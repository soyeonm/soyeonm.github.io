I am a first year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University's Machine Learning Department (MLD). I am co-advised by Professors [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) and [Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com/index.html). 
I earned my B.S. and M.Eng at MIT, where I worked with Professor [Peter Szolovits](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/) and [Dr. Preethi Raghavan](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-praghav). 

I am interested in the following topics:

* Learning with external knowledge/ weak supervision
* Efficient/ few-shot robotic navigation with external knowledge
* Efficient self-supervised/ weakly supervised learning
